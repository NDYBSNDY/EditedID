Official implementation of:

**Optimizing ID Consistency in Multimodal Large Models:  Facial Restoration via Alignment, Entanglement, and Disentanglement**

---

## 🔥 News

- [2026/02] Paper accepted to ICLR :)
- Code release is in progress.

---

## 📌 Overview

We propose a unified framework for optimizing identity consistency in multimodal large models through:

- Alignment
- Entanglement
- Disentanglement

This repository will provide inference and training code for facial restoration and ID-preserving generation.

---

## 🛠️ TODO

- [ ] Release inference code
- [ ] Add installation instructions
- [ ] Add demo scripts
- [ ] Upload sample results
- [ ] Add detailed documentation

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Due to internal code refactoring and dependency cleanup, the full training pipeline is not yet available.
We will progressively release components after publication.
